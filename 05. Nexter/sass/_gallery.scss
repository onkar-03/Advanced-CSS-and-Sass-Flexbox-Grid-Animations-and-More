    // Then set the image size to cover
    // object-fit: cover is a CSS property that specifies how an image or video should be resized to fit its container.
    // background-size: cover is used specifically for CSS backgrounds, while object-fit: cover is used for controlling the display of replaced elements like images and videos.
